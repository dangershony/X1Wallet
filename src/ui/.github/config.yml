  We use [conventional commits](https://github.com/LN-Zap/zap-desktop/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#committing-and-pushing-changes) to streamline the release process. Before your pull request can be merged, you should **squash your commits and reword your commit messages** to follow the conventional commit message format.
  Examples of commit messages with semantic prefixes:
  - `fix(ui): ensure search input is cleared after submit`
  - `feat(wallet): add new transaction detail view`
  - `perf(channels): prevent double render in channel list`
  Things that will help get your PR across the finish line:
  - Run `yarn lint` locally to catch formatting errors earlier.
  - Run `yarn test` locally to catch test failures early.
  - Run `yarn extract-messages` locally to extract new transaction strings.
  - Document any user-facing changes you've made.
  - Include tests when adding/changing behavior.
  - Include screenshots and animated GIFs whenever possible.
